# Power_BI_SALES_Analytics_Dashboard-
Sales Analytics Dashboard" is the first practice Power BI project that I am thrilled to present.  This project's main objective is to assist organisations in determining the total sales amount and number of boxes for each product based on the specific region.
To let salespeople easily determine which clients prefer their items and to help organisations identify which salespeople have performed exceptionally well.

As the given data was very straightforward, the project procedure is broken down as follows:

*Data Extraction: I brought in the information in an Excel file.
*Data Transformation: After the data was imported into Power BI, it was cleaned up by removing null values and duplicates, fixing spelling mistakes, and standardising the data type using Power Query. 
*Data Loading: In order to conduct additional analysis, the converted data was put into Power View. 
*Data visualisation: I made the dashboard after processing the data using tools and visualisations.
*Report Building: I hope you found the reports and visualisations I created to build the dashboard to be clear and easy to use.
